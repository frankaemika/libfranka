   * @name Motion generation and joint-level torque commands
   *
   * The following methods allow to perform motion generation and/or send joint-level torque
   * commands without gravity and friction by providing callback functions.
   *
   * Only one of these methods can be active at the same time; a franka::ControlException is thrown
   * otherwise.
   *
   * @anchor callback-docs
   * When a robot state is received, the callback function is used to calculate the response: the
   * desired values for that time step. After sending back the response, the callback function will
   * be called again with the most recently received robot state. Since the robot is controlled with
   * a 1 kHz frequency, the callback functions have to compute their result in a short time frame
   * in order to be accepted. Callback functions take two parameters:
   *
   * * A franka::RobotState showing the current robot state.
   * * A franka::Duration to indicate the time since the last callback invocation. Thus, the
   *   duration is zero on the first invocation of the callback function!
   *
   * The following incomplete example shows the general structure of a callback function:
   *
   * @code{.cpp}
   * double time = 0.0;
   * auto control_callback = [&time](const franka::RobotState& robot_state,
   *                                 franka::Duration time_step) -> franka::JointPositions {
   *   time += time_step.toSec();  // Update time at the beginning of the callback.
   *
   *   franka::JointPositions output = getJointPositions(time);
   *
   *   if (time >= max_time) {
   *     // Return MotionFinished at the end of the trajectory.
   *     return franka::MotionFinished(output);
   *   }
   *
   *   return output;
