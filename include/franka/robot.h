 * The members of this class are threadsafe.
 *
 * @anchor o-frame
 * @par Base frame O
 * The base frame is located at the center of the robot's base. Its z-axis is identical with the
 * axis of rotation of the first joint.
 *
 * @anchor f-frame
 * @par Flange frame F
 * The flange frame is located at the center of the flange surface. Its z-axis is identical with the
 * axis of rotation of the last joint. This frame is fixed and cannot be changed.
 *
 * @anchor ne-frame
 * @par Nominal end effector frame NE
 * The nominal end effector frame is configured outside of libfranka (in DESK) and cannot be changed
 * here. It may be used to set end effector frames which are rarely changed.
 *
 * @anchor ee-frame
 * @par end effector frame EE
 * By default, the end effector frame EE is the same as the nominal end effector frame NE
 * (i.e. the transformation between NE and EE is the identity transformation). It may be used to set
 * end effector frames which are changed more frequently (such as a tool that is grasped with the
 * end effector). With Robot::setEE, a custom transformation matrix can be set.
 *
 * @anchor k-frame
 * @par Stiffness frame K
 * This frame describes the transformation from the end effector frame EE to the stiffness frame
 * K. The stiffness frame is used for Cartesian impedance control, and for measuring and applying
 * forces. The values set using Robot::setCartesianImpedance are used in the direction
 * of the stiffness frame. It can be set with Robot::setK. This frame allows to modify the
 * compliance behavior of the robot (e.g. to have a low stiffness around a specific point which
 * is not the end effector). The stiffness frame does not affect where the robot will move to.
 * The user should always command the desired end effector frame (and not the desired stiffness
 * frame).

   * @name Motion generation and joint-level torque commands
   *
   * The following methods allow to perform motion generation and/or send joint-level torque
   * commands without gravity and friction by providing callback functions.
   *
   * Only one of these methods can be active at the same time; a franka::ControlException is thrown
   * otherwise.
   *
   * @anchor callback-docs
   * When a robot state is received, the callback function is used to calculate the response: the
   * desired values for that time step. After sending back the response, the callback function will
   * be called again with the most recently received robot state. Since the robot is controlled with
   * a 1 kHz frequency, the callback functions have to compute their result in a short time frame
   * in order to be accepted. Callback functions take two parameters:
   *
   * * A franka::RobotState showing the current robot state.
   * * A franka::Duration to indicate the time since the last callback invocation. Thus, the
   *   duration is zero on the first invocation of the callback function!
   *
   * The following incomplete example shows the general structure of a callback function:
   *
   * @code{.cpp}
   * double time = 0.0;
   * auto control_callback = [&time](const franka::RobotState& robot_state,
   *                                 franka::Duration time_step) -> franka::JointPositions {
   *   time += time_step.toSec();  // Update time at the beginning of the callback.
   *
   *   franka::JointPositions output = getJointPositions(time);
   *
   *   if (time >= max_time) {
   *     // Return MotionFinished at the end of the trajectory.
   *     return franka::MotionFinished(output);
   *   }

   *   return output;
